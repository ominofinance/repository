Omino is a DeFi project whose primary objective is to maximize profits for its users majorly through asset staking and yield farming. In comparison to Harvest, Omino uses an automated and algorithmic model similar to Pancakeswap to ensure returns and achieve low slippage. One thing that all blockchains have in common is that transactions must be confirmed. Bitcoin, for example, accomplishes this through a process known as mining, which is known to consume a significant amount of electricity (Proof-of-Work). Other consensus processes, on the other hand, are utilized for validation, with our unique model, users would be able to earn as much as 250% ROI by farming with OMINO.
